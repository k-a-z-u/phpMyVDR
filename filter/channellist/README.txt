This folder provides facilities for setting up channel filters
that can be used within the GUI e.g. for listing only all shows
on channels within such a list.

To create a new channel list, simply create a file within this
folder named "AnyNameYouWant.lst" and write the name of
each channel (one per line) you want to add to this list
